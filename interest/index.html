                <p>I'm currently undecided, but I'm sure my major will be something that is based on mathematics.
                I admit that it is not a subject that everyone enjoys, and I also didn't enjoy at the first place,
              but through my own effort and various high school experiences of maths it became one of my favorite subjects and the one I applied universities for.
              <br><br> Indeed, it is hard, but as long as we always remember the basics the next steps shouldn't be as hard as you think.
               <br><br> After coming to college, I realized that maths is a core part of many other fields like computer science and data science, so it also grants me with various career options for the future.
               <br><br> Sometimes I realize the fact that there are loads of geniuses beyond me, but it should be fine, as long as I maintain the passion for it!</p>
