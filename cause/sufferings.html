                      Shelters in New York and Los Angeles are reporting that they are nearing capacity as more people are dumping their pets during the pandemic. The reason is because they get the pets at the times of social distancing and abandon them as the world inches back to normal. Animal Care centers at NYU saw around 1400 animals brought to them last month, which is more than twice the number of dogs and cats surrendered in February. <br>
                      According to the development coordinator at Wags and Walks adoption center in Los Angeles, they received prior to the pandemic five to 10 inquiries per month for people who couldn't care for their dogs anymore, and that has doubled in recent months. The situation is similar in Dallas and Philadelphia - people are  leaving bags of kittens and their mother on doorsteps and intakes at the facilities.<br>

                      Although animal abuse is less frequent than abandoning, still it is an international issue that has been continuing for the entire history. Media reports suggest that animal abuse is common in both rural and urban areas. Also, it was reported that intentional cruelty to animals is strongly correlated with other crimes, including violence against people.<br>
                      The cases of abuse have been reported most often for dogs, cats, horses and livestock. It is easy for people to care for pets around them, but many of them often forget about how livestocks are often mistreated. According to undercover investigations, animal abuse is prevalent in the factory farm industry. However, because of the weak protections afforded to livestock under state cruelty laws, only the most shocking cases are reported, and few are ever prosecuted.

                    <p class="lead">
                      Could animal abuse be relevant to human abuse?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Data on domestic violence and child abuse reveal that a large number of animals are targeted by those who abuse their children or spouses. According to a survey, 71 percent of victims of domestic violence reported that the abusers also targeted their pets. This is a horrible fact, but knowing this would provide a fundamental solution to resolving this problem.<br>
                      To prevent and reduce this pattern of violence, the Humane Society Legislative Fund supported the Pets and Womenâ€™s Safety (PAWS) Act, which was enacted by the farm bill and signed by President Trump in 2018. Full enactment of this PAWS Act would help more victoms of domestic abuse and their companion animals escape from thier abusers.
