          <h1>About me!</h1>
          <p>Just to briefly introduce myself, I'm Korean, and as you can see on the timeline below, I have never lived anywhere else apart from the study abroad I went on 2011. <br>
            Instead, I have been to an international school in an island, which I'd stayed for 8 years until I graduated last year. <br>
            It felt a bit like being quarantined staying in an island for 8 years, but in this school I have made so much memories, friends and also developed my English skills.<br>
            (After all, that is how I got into NYU!) Right now, I'm not much enjoying my college life as I'm studying remotely in Seoul, but I'm so excited to go to the campus this fall!</p>
